     <h1>Welcome to Ditto!</h1>
     <p>Ditto is a word-guessing game. </p>
     <ul>
        <li>Rules:
        <ul>
            <li>Round 0: type in any random word
            </li>
            <li>Your objective in the following rounds is to generate a word that relates all the words from a previous round
            <ul>
                <li>ex) Round 0: “can” “socks” “special” “cheese”
                </li>
                <li>Your logic may be that cans, socks, and cheese are all sold in stores, so your next word is “store”
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your word cannot be a proper noun or repeated from a previous round
            </li>
            <li>The game ends when everyone types the same word
            </li>
            <li>Your objective is for everyone to type the same word in the fewest number of rounds possible
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Notes:
